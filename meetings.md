## Meeting 2.
* **DATE:** 1.3.2021
* **ASSISTANTS:** Mika Oja

### Minutes
We discussed the second deadline. Descriptions should be longer than 256 characters. Widgets content should be a blob field instead of character field. Scripts and such would be good to be a part of layouts instead of widgets. Cascade needs to be in both sides of the relationship. One-to-many relationships do not need to be defined in both sides. Foreign keys in SQLite.


### Action points
* Fix tables
* Add cascade to other side of the relationship
* Remove unnecessary relationship from one-to-many relationships.
* Add pragma to make foreign keys work correctly
